                <p class="much-text"> Create an e-commerce website for a
                    leather shoe company called ‘Letha’.
                    The company emphasizes that their
                    shoes are handcrafted and that the
                    leather they use is organic and
                    sustainably made. Letha has a target
                    audience of affluent and trendy 20 and
                    30 somethings.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p class="much-text"> The process included design, testing, and developing of
                    the website. I chose a clean, light design, with boxes displaying and highlighting
                    the products for easy navigation.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 order-sm-1">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p class="much-text">I started the task by making a prototype of the website using Adobe XD.
                I tried to make it look as clean as I could, without making it seem boring. I designed
                eight different pages with seven unique designs.
            </p>
            <p class="much-text">As already mentioned, I chose a clean, light site with large boxes for
                easy navigation throughout the website. After the design, the test-personas tried to
                navigate through the site.</p>
            <p class="much-text">The response was what I was hoping for; that the site looked clean and was easy to navigate</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 order-sm-2 align-self-center">

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 order-sm-1">
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p class="much-text">For this project, I used Bootstrap 4 for the layout. This is a good framework that makes it easy to
                prototype the site with fast results.
                I quickly understood that this task was possible to do according to my design.
            </p>
            <p class="much-text"> On desktop, I have used one modal-image for displaying the product. On mobile. this is replaced with a carousel
            you can click through yourself. </p>

        <div class="col-md-6 order-sm-1">
            <h3>Recent changes</h3>
            <p class="much-text"> In recent changes, I made the website more mobile-friendly. I switched the modal image to carousel on smaller devices,
                and made the product stack two in a row instead of one in a row.
            </p>
            <p class="much-text"> I made the search field in the header longer, as this was the thing i got feedback on the first time I
            delivered the product. </p>
            <p class="much-text"> I also optimized the images on the site for faster loading time. I also centered the text of the footer. </p>

            <h2>Self-evaluating</h2>
            <p class="much-text">Letha was a fun project. To make an e-commerce website was exciting to me,
                because it is one of the things I wanted to learn to make. I think that this site turned out
                a little better than okay. It has a good design, however, it can look a bit "boxy" with all
                the hard corners around the products.</p>
            <p class="much-text"> Since this one of my first large project, I am happy with how it turned out.
                I fixed the responsive part of the site, and it now looks a bit better on mobile devices. </p>
